SBLIM CIM Client library (Java library)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example about how to produce a code skeleton based on 
predefined templates using the SBLIM Common Information 
Model (CIM) Client library (the Java library from SBLIM/IBM project). 
With CIM, most client-side applications serve as the CIM clients. 
They use standard CIM XML-over-HTTP protocol for communication with 
the CIM server. It's inconvenient to encode and decode CIM-XML 
statements directly. The SBLIM CIM Client gives you standard 
APIs that can facilitate CIM client development.

The code skeleton makes easier to implement a CIM client application,
and maintain the application in the future.

The SBLIM CIM Client is a Java implementation of a WBEM services client.
This library is conform "JSR 48: WBEM Services Specification" [1].

This documentation is based on the original article from IBM DevelopmentWorks [2]

The code skeleton generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are three steps for generating a code skeleton:

1. Define the code template according to your requirements.
2. Retrieve the CIM elements definition by mining the CIM server directly 
   with the SBLIM CIM Client library.
3. Import the skeleton template and CIM elements information, 
   and generate an object-oriented code skeleton set for CIM client development.
