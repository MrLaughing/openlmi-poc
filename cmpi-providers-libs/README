The Cura Project is based in the following Tools/libraries for 
CMPI providers development: PyWBEM and konkretcmpi.

PyWBEM is used in the testing tools of cura-networking and cura-providers
subprojects, and is strongly used in the development of cura-storage implementation.

PyWBEM
~~~~~~

This python provider interface can run under any CIMON (CIM server) that fully supports
CMPI provider interface. So you can choose to use either Pegasus [1] or SFCB [2]

[1] https://collaboration.opengroup.org/pegasus/
[2] http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/sblim/index.php?title=Sfcb

konkretcmpi
~~~~~~~~~~~

Tool for rapidly developing CMPI providers in the C programming language.

    (WBEM CIM-XML client using WQL)     CIM providres based on KonkretCMPI [cura-prividers, cura-networking]


SBLIM CIM Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the other hand in this folder we've an example of CIM client using the Java library from the SBLIM project.
