	-h talos -P 16992 -k RequestedStated=2

wsman enumerate -h talos -P 16992 http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/*

Part of the DMTF WS-Management specification:

$ wsman identify -h talos -P 16992

- PC Needs to be woken up remotely on a wired network (DSP2014_1.1.0.pdf)

PCs that have Wake On LAN configured will awake on receipt of the Magic Packet. 
DASH pro- vides a similar capability through the Out Of Band DASH Service. An 
administrator, using a SOAP client program which perhaps has been extended 
for DASH, formulates a query to locate the computer systems at a Management 
Access Point accessible through a WS-Management Service transport address. 
If the target computer is located, the Administrator fetches the associated 
CIM_PowerManagementCapabilities instance, and examines the 
PowerChangeCapabilities and property. 

If the computer supports setting its enabled state to 2 (enabled), the 
Administrator executes the extrinsic method RequestStateChange() on the 
computer instance.  

- Enumerate classes:

From the class list in http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/cim-schema/2/ 
we can enumerate with:

wsman enumerate \
	-h talos -P 16992 \
	http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/cim-schema/2/[???]

Example:

wsman enumerate \
	-h talos -P 16992 \
	http://schemas.dmtf.org/wbem/wscim/1/cim-schema/2/CIM_PowerManagementCapabilities
