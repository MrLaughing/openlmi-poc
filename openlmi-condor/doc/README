LMI_BasicExecutionServiceCondorFactory is the manager
of jobs (activities) with the method CreateActivity.

In Condor the manager of jobs is the condor_schedd in the
condor pool. There are one or more condor_schedd in a
Condor pool. So we can instantiate one BESCondorFactory
per condor_schedd in the Condor pool. The manager of jobs
in Condor is the queue of jobs, one job queue for 
condor_schedd.

We send jobs (activities) per BESCondorFactory instance.
And we make management procedures (condor management tasks)
per BESCondorManagement, one instance per Host in the pool.
